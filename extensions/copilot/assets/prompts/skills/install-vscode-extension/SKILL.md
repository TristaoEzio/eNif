# Installing eNif extensions

1. eNif extensions are identified by their unique extension ID, which typically follows the format `publisher.extensionName`. For example, the Python extension by Microsoft has the ID `ms-python.python`.
2. To install a eNif extension, you need to use the eNif command `workbench.extensions.installExtension` and pass in the extension ID. The args are of the format:
```
[extensionId, { enable: true, installPreReleaseVersion: boolean }]
```
> NOTE: install the pre-release version of the extension if the user explicitly mentions it or if the current environment is eNif Insiders. Otherwise, install the stable version.
3. Run that command via the `copilot_runVscodeCommand` tool. Make sure to pass the `skipCheck` argument as true to avoid checking if the command exists, as we know it does.
